# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb datasets to better understand:
1. Where are Airbnb rooms commonly located?
2. What are the prices of Airbnb rooms compared to hotels?
3. Are there seasonality of prices?

# File Descriptions
There are two notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions, and the data are in the data folder.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kwok723/airbnb-in-shanghai-db66177e54f6).

# Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find other data of Airbnb here.
