# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Airbnb datasets to better understand:
1. How much did covid-19 influence the business
2. How popular is Airbnb in both cities
3. What are the differences between two cities

# File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions, and the data are in the data folder.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.

# Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find other data of Airbnb here.
