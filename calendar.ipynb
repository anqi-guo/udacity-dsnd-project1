We felt very much at home and had a great time. My husband and I were there for the World Expo so we, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood as much as we liked, but it of what we saw, we really liked. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>My only complaint is that the apartment we stayed in was in a very residential area and the walk to the subway was a bit far. Taxis are very affordable, but sometimes difficult to find a free one. Of course this might not pertain to the actual apt Jia has listed, which, I think, is located closer to the subway. \\r<br/>\\r<br/>Overall, Jia was a great host. She was very accommodating, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. She helped us order a taxi on our last day and even introduced us to local Chinese teas and fruits as well. :) I would highly recommend her!   \n",
              "1  Jia's place is in a vibrant and (in my opinion!) the most beautiful section of Shanghai. The French Concession is known for its leafy streets lined with cafes, boutique shops, upscale spas, yoga studios, and art galleries. Shanghai’s nickname as the “Paris of the East” evidently stems from the tree-lined avenues, Tudor mansions and French-influence architecture of this district. Exploring every alley of this graceful district would likely take a long time, and the constant renewal process that occurs in Shanghai insures that the urban landscape will likely be quite different in a few years than what it offers today. In particular I liked the area just north of Huaihai Rd, as Fenyang Rd. turns into Donghu Rd. Within a 10-minute walk you have your choice of dozens of upscale delicious ethnic restaurants and it is less than a 10-minute walk to Changshu Rd. subway station. Centrally located within Puxi, the center of Shanghai, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. One thing I really like about Jia's apartment is that music can be heard from all corners of the apartment complex. Just next door a junior high school student practiced the violin for hours upon hours a day. Across the courtyard, there was the sound of a saxophone, and around the corner someone practiced Chinese folk songs on a dizi. This really enchanted my daily life. Since the apartment is just around the corner from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the entire area is packed with music shops selling scores, CDs, and instruments. The apartment is not large but clean, well-appointed, and gets great light. I really enjoyed washing my laundry and hanging it out to air-dry on bamboo poles like my Chinese neighbors! Make sure you you use clips though, or your clothes will fall down to the 1st floor garden apartment! The friendly security guard had to help me retrieve my clothes. The apartment is in a very safe area and is constantly under surveillance by a security guard. Although it is always a good idea to lock your windows in any large city, it is unlikely that a thief could enter this complex unnoticed. At night, a large gate to the complex is closed to prevent traffic from entering and guests must check in with a security guard. Although Fuxing Rd. is busy and noisy, the apartment is set back from the main road so it is quiet and peaceful at night. There were a few minor maintenance issues with the apartment during the time I was there, but Jia always responded promptly. Even when she couldn't come over herself, her adorable father would eagerly come over to help! I must admit that my body didn't react well at first to Shanghai and I was sick on and off for about two months, not to mention suffering somewhat from culture shock. Jia helped me more than once with medicine and the like and provided a compassionate ear. On more than one occasion she invited me...  \n",

It was easy to find by taxi or subway, close to city, subway, restaurants, small market and in a great safe neighbohood.  She met us at the apt with the keys and showed us how everything worked.  Neighbors were quiet and we were able to sleep in whenever we wanted.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Jia also drew us a map of area for our first night and day so we could get our barings.  It was also great to have internet service in the apt so we could stay in contact and upload pictures of our trip for family and friends.  \\r<br/>\\r<br/>The apartment was clean and the perfect size for me and my husband to stay for a week.  We were able to spread out and not be on top of one another like we would have been in a hotel room.  We were able to make dinner and breakfast if we wanted in the kitchen.  Jia was also very kind in giving us information prior to our arrival whenever I sent emails to ask.  She was very prompt and always responsive.  While there she sent emails to check in on us and make sure everything was going well.  She also had a housekeeper come in and clean up for us during our stay.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I would stay in Jia's apt again and recommend her apt to family anf friends.  \n",

We felt very much at home and had a great time. My husband and I were there for the World Expo so we, unfortunately, didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood as much as we liked, but it of what we saw, we really liked. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;My only complaint is that the apartment we stayed in was in a very residential area and the walk to the subway was a bit far. Taxis are very affordable, but sometimes difficult to find a free one. Of course this might not pertain to the actual apt Jia has listed, which, I think, is located closer to the subway. \\r&lt;br/&gt;\\r&lt;br/&gt;Overall, Jia was a great host. She was very accommodating, helpful and made us feel very welcomed. She helped us order a taxi on our last day and even introduced us to local Chinese teas and fruits as well. :) I would highly recommend her!</td>\n",

The French Concession is known for its leafy streets lined with cafes, boutique shops, upscale spas, yoga studios, and art galleries. Shanghai’s nickname as the “Paris of the East” evidently stems from the tree-lined avenues, Tudor mansions and French-influence architecture of this district. Exploring every alley of this graceful district would likely take a long time, and the constant renewal process that occurs in Shanghai insures that the urban landscape will likely be quite different in a few years than what it offers today. In particular I liked the area just north of Huaihai Rd, as Fenyang Rd. turns into Donghu Rd. Within a 10-minute walk you have your choice of dozens of upscale delicious ethnic restaurants and it is less than a 10-minute walk to Changshu Rd. subway station. Centrally located within Puxi, the center of Shanghai, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. One thing I really like about Jia's apartment is that music can be heard from all corners of the apartment complex. Just next door a junior high school student practiced the violin for hours upon hours a day. Across the courtyard, there was the sound of a saxophone, and around the corner someone practiced Chinese folk songs on a dizi. This really enchanted my daily life. Since the apartment is just around the corner from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the entire area is packed with music shops selling scores, CDs, and instruments. The apartment is not large but clean, well-appointed, and gets great light. I really enjoyed washing my laundry and hanging it out to air-dry on bamboo poles like my Chinese neighbors! Make sure you you use clips though, or your clothes will fall down to the 1st floor garden apartment! The friendly security guard had to help me retrieve my clothes. The apartment is in a very safe area and is constantly under surveillance by a security guard. Although it is always a good idea to lock your windows in any large city, it is unlikely that a thief could enter this complex unnoticed. At night, a large gate to the complex is closed to prevent traffic from entering and guests must check in with a security guard. Although Fuxing Rd. is busy and noisy, the apartment is set back from the main road so it is quiet and peaceful at night. There were a few minor maintenance issues with the apartment during the time I was there, but Jia always responded promptly. Even when she couldn't come over herself, her adorable father would eagerly come over to help! I must admit that my body didn't react well at first to Shanghai and I was sick on and off for about two months, not to mention suffering somewhat from culture shock. Jia helped me more than once with medicine and the like and provided a compassionate ear. On more than one occasion she invited me...</td>\n",

We were able to spread out and not be on top of one another like we would have been in a hotel room.  We were able to make dinner and breakfast if we wanted in the kitchen.  Jia was also very kind in giving us information prior to our arrival whenever I sent emails to ask.  She was very prompt and always responsive.  While there she sent emails to check in on us and make sure everything was going well.
